                    <li>It is implemented via millions of copper wires and fiber optic wires connecting
                        millions of computers and other networked devices.

                    <li>The broadband modem is a bridge between the network hardware outside the house and the network hardware inside the
                        house. These devices are often supplied by the Internet Service Provider.

                    </li>
                    <li>Fiber junction boxes connect slower and older copper lines to higher bandwidth fiber optic cables.</li>
                    <li>Data centers requires high bandwidth due to which they are often directly connected to 
                        Internet Exchange Point.
                    </li>
                    <li>Internet Backbone is the Tier 1 networks i.e., the first line of network. They use very fast 
                        fiver optic cable.
