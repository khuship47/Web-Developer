                        <li><strong>Port: </strong>It is a software connection point used by the underlying 
                            TCP/IP protocol and the connecting computer. Port 80 is the default port for 
                            web-related HTTP requests. It is added after the domain name with ':'.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Path: </strong>It identifies a file or directory to access on that server.
                            When requesting a folder, if the path is not mentioned, the web server will decide which
                            file to send you.

                            input, from the client to the server. They are encoded as key value pairs delimited by '&' 
                            and preceded by '?' symbol.
