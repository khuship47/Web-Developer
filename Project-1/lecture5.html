                    <li>The server waits for the request, and then responds with a header, response code, and an optional message.</li>
                    <li>HTTP headers
                        <ul>
                            <li>Headers are sent in the request from the client and received in the response from the server. </li>
                            <li>Request headers include data about the client machine i.e., host, cache settings and more.</li>
                            <li>Response headers have information about the server answering the request and the data being sent 
                                which includes serverm content type, encoding, and last modified.

                        <ul>
                            <li>GET request is made whenever an URL is searched on a browser. User is trying to find resource 
                                located at a specific URL to be retrieved. Data can be transmitted through a GET request, 
                                with a query string.
                            </li>
                            <li>POST request is normally used to transmit data to the server using an HTML form. 
                                An example would be a submit button.
                            </li>

                            <li>These are integer values returned by the server as a part of the response header.</li>
                            <li>2## codes are for successful reponses. E.g. 200</li>
                            <li>3## codes are for redirection-related responses. E.g. 301 and 304</li>
                            <li>4## codes are for client errors. E.g. 401, 404(most common), and 414</li>
                            <li>5## codes are for server errors. E.g. 505</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers are the place where a web page is displayed.</li>
                    <li>Web page requests the inital HTML page, then parses the returned HTML to find all the resources
                        referenced from within the program. Once all files have been retrieved, the page will be fully 
                        loaded.
                    </li>
                    <li>A single web page might require many HTTP requests and responses.</li>
                    <li>The algorithm within browsers to download, parse, fetch assests, layout, and create the final 
                        interactive page for the user are collectively called rendering of the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once a webpage has been downloaded from the server, it’s possible that the user, a short time 
                        later, wants to see the same web page and refreshes the browser or rerequests the URL. This is 
                        known as browser caching.
                    </li>
                    <li>Browser caching has a significant impact in reducing network traffic.

            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML is a markup language. A markup lnaguage is simply a way of annotating a 
                        document in such a way as to make the annotations distinct from the text 
                        being annotated.
                    </li>
                    <li>The initial HTML specification cam in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau.</li>
                    <li>“browser wars” in the mid 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
                        Explorer motivated many new tags and features such as CSS and JavaScript, but the 
                        development of new features happened quickly, and interoperability between browsers 
                        became a major issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>W3C developed a new specification in late 1990s called XHTML 1.0 that used stricter <strong>XML </strong>(
                        Extensible Markup Language). Later, XHTML 1.0 Transitional was also created which allowed web authors to 
                        use presentational elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>The goal of XHTML with its strict rules was to make page rendering more predictable 
                        by forcing web authors to create web pages without syntax errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are three main aimsa to HTML5
                        <ol>
                            <li>Specify unambiguously how browsers should deal with invalid markup.</li>
                            <li>Provide an open, nonproprietary programming framework (via JavaScript) for creating rich web applications.</li>
                            <li>Be backward compatible with the existing web.</li>
                        </ol>
