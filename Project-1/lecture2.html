                    <li>Sr. Tim Berners-Lee published main features of web in 19921</li>
                    <li>A Uniform Resource Locator <strong>(URL)</strong> to uniquely identify a resource on the WWW. </li>
                    <li>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol <strong>(HTTP)</strong> to describe how requests and response operate.</li>
                    <li>A software program <strong>(web server software)</strong> that can respond to HTTP requests.</li>
                    <li>Hypertext Markup Language <strong>(HTML)</strong> to publish documents.</li>
                    <li>A program<strong> (browser)</strong> that can make HTTP requests to URLs and that can display
                    the HTML it receives.</li>

            <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be accessed from any Internet-enabled computer.</li>
                    <li>Can be used with different OS and browser applications.</li>
                    <li>Easier to update as only the server needs to be updated, and not every computer
                        in the buidling using that software.
                    </li>
                    <li>Centralized storage on the server, means less security problems than storing locally.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><u>Types of Networks</u></h3>
            <p><strong>Circuit switching: </strong> In the past, phones were routed through operators
                who physically connected the caller and the receiver by connecting a wire to a switchboard 
                to complete the circuit. It was difficult to scale and bandwidth was used inefficiently. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Packet switching: </strong>It coes not require a continuous connection. The message
                was sent in packets with a number at the start, so when receiver gets the message the numbers
                are put together to complete the message.

            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Development can be understood as a complex ecosystem that builds on existing 
                        technologies and contributes new protocols and standards that facilitates 
                        client-server interaction.
                    </li>
                    <li> Web pages evolved from static to dynamic, means now web pages are hosted on a server 
                        which lets websites generate content dynamically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Programs are needed because to make things flexible, so when need to revise the design it becomes easier.</li>
                    <li>Web development today is thus more complicated than it was when initially started.</li>
